# Smart River (Desktop) Executable-Only

Smart River Project is a cross-device platform that underlines the context of science communication, technology, and engineering mixing. The focus of the project is to analyze all the data received by four (n=4) sensors points installed under the "Fervença River" in Portugal. We receive the data with a raspberry PI and the unity-based application translates all the data graphs in a "gamification mode". The program shows the respective attributes of Relative Air Humidity, Water Temperature, Ambient Temperature, Conductivity, and pH of the river. By generating 3D Graphs made, the program uses an average analysis by week and by months of the year and shows the data in an animated way to the visitors of the Science Center Museum in Bragança-Portugal.
